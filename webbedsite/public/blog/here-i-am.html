    <p>Welcome to my (at least temporarily) somewhat hidden RSS blog! I'm going to develop a program that takes the RSS output and turns it into articles for the main site, but until then it will only be accessible thru this manner.</p>
    <p>I'm not the most eloquent person, so I don't expect much readership. I will mostly post brief musings somewhat regularly for now, until I find a good reason to put together something longer. I originally wanted to start this up with a bang, but as time went on and I did my usual dance, horribly unsatisfied with everything I made and scrapping it any time it would be close to release, I figure that at this point it would be far better to make something, even something mediocre, rather than just hoping for a state of perfection that would never be reached. In my experience, you only get better at things by actually doing them, and learning from sharing with those around you tends to yield much quicker results than hiding your work.</p>
    <p>>I am releasing this with three goals in mind:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rather than toiling with literally nothing to show for my work, this will at least make little green boxes appear on my github for any future employers.</li>
        <li>I have many thoughts, even though I tend to express them poorly, and putting them somewhere is better than putting them nowhere.</li>
        <li>If I ever feel I do have something worth saying, it's better that I get practice sharing these thoughts now. Sucking at something is the first step to being kind of good at something.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For those choosing to spend their valuable time with me here, I hope I manage to make it worth your while.</p><br>
    <p>Future plans for here from here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the site look pretty</li>
        <li>If I haven't sorted it out yet, make the RSS articles navigable on the site</li>
        <li>Make a tagging system. Knowing myself, I'll regret it if I don't work on this early</li>
        <li>Write a second article. This one will be either about something that happened in my day or talking on a broader topic, whichever feels more relevant at the time.</li>
    </ul>
